- 👋 Hi, I’m @AAAhmeyselll

- 👀 I’m interested in probability and mathematical analysis and creating and solving different problems.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and C/C++

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source Python projects, especially those focused on data analysis, machine learning, or scientific computing with numpy.

- 📫 How to reach me : LinkedIn Account (Ahmeysel)

- 😄 Pronouns: He / him

- ⚡ Fun fact: My idea of a good time is hiking up a mountain, getting lost (on purpose), and finding my way back with just a compass and a sense of adventure.
